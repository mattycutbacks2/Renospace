-- NUCLEAR OPTION: Disable all RLS to get the app working immediately
-- Run this in your Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor

-- 0. Create the uploads bucket if it doesn't exist
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('uploads', 'uploads', TRUE)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- 1. Turn off RLS on storage schema completely
ALTER TABLE storage.buckets DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE storage.objects DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. Wipe out any leftover storage policies
DO $$
DECLARE
  rec RECORD;
BEGIN
  FOR rec IN (
    SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname
      FROM pg_policies
     WHERE schemaname = 'storage'
  )
  LOOP
    EXECUTE format(
      'DROP POLICY IF EXISTS %I ON %I.%I',
      rec.policyname, rec.schemaname, rec.tablename
    );
  END LOOP;
END
$$;

-- 3. Re-create totally open policies for storage.objects
CREATE POLICY public_insert_objects
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY public_select_objects
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- 2. Make sure the uploads bucket allows everything
UPDATE storage.buckets SET public = true WHERE id = 'uploads';

-- 3. Drop all restrictive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on uploads bucket" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public upload access" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public read access" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated Upload on uploads" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public Read on uploads" ON storage.objects;

-- 4. Create one simple permissive policy for storage
CREATE POLICY "Allow everything on storage" ON storage.objects FOR ALL USING (true);

-- 5. Also disable RLS on generated_images table temporarily
ALTER TABLE generated_images DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 6. Drop all restrictive policies on generated_images
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own generated images" ON generated_images;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own generated images" ON generated_images;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own generated images" ON generated_images;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own generated images" ON generated_images;

-- 7. Create one simple permissive policy for generated_images
CREATE POLICY "Allow everything on generated_images" ON generated_images FOR ALL USING (true);

-- 8. Make sure the results bucket is also public
UPDATE storage.buckets SET public = true WHERE id = 'results';

-- 9. Create a simple policy for results bucket too
CREATE POLICY "Allow everything on results" ON storage.objects FOR ALL USING (bucket_id = 'results');

-- DONE! Your app should now work without any RLS errors.
